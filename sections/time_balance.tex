\subsection*{Time Balance}

    In your respective tab in the time report you can see your time balance for each week. If you have less then 40 hours you either have not worked the full amount or forgotten to fill in the time report. If you have more then 40 hours then the extra time becomes your flex time.
     
    You can use flex time to take time off (same rules as in 'Time off' applies).
