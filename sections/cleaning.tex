\subsection*{Cleaning}

    Every Friday at 09.00 is cleaning time. Follow the cleaning schedule and help each other out to clean all the rooms that are held by the project.
     
    This is \textbf{mandatory} for each project member.
     
    Since we use the appliances and utensils in the kitchen it is expected for all project members to \textbf{lead by example} and clean after themselves. This means that if you use coffee cups or anything else it is to be returned and cleaned after use, this also applies to kitchen counters and the floor depending on its status.
