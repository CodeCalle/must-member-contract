\subsection*{Sick leave}
    In case of sickness, contact your nearest Team leader (TL)/ Project Manager (PM) as soon as possible. The communication to be used is preferred to be a private message to the TL / PM via Teams.
     
    The most important thing is that you get better, hence why sick leave is \textbf{counted as work hours}.

\subsubsection*{Rules regarding sick leave}
    
    For non-pandemic times: You are allowed one week of leave without a doctor's notice, e.g. day 1 - 7. From day 8 a doctor's notice is \textbf{required}.
    
    \textbf{Example:} You get sick on Monday, the next Monday will be the 8th day and a doctor's notice will be required at that time.
