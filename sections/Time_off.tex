\subsection*{Time off}

    Depending on the amount of time you want to take off follow the list below:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[]\textbf{0-4 hours:} Team leader
        \item[]\textbf{8 hours:} Project manager
        \item[]\textbf{More then 8 hours:} Project manager that contact Project Owner / Examiner for approval
    \end{itemize}
    
    Time off is \textbf{NOT} counted as working hours, thus you need to compensate for the time taken off.
